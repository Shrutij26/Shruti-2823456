# Hangman Game 🎮

Welcome to my Hangman Game project! This is a simple and interactive version of the classic Hangman game built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**.

## 👩‍💻 About Me

Hi! I’m **Shruti**, currently pursuing **B.Tech in Computer Science and Engineering (Artificial Intelligence & Machine Learning)** from **Panipat Institute of Engineering and Technology (PIET)**, affiliated with **Kurukshetra University**. This is one of my front-end development projects created as part of my learning journey.

## 📂 Project Description

This project is a web-based implementation of the Hangman game where:

- A random word is selected.
- You guess letters to uncover the word.
- You lose if you exceed a set number of wrong guesses.

It's designed to test your vocabulary in a fun way while practicing DOM manipulation and JavaScript logic.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **HTML** – for structuring the web page
- **CSS** – for styling the UI
